    "abstract": "Computational Intelligence (CI), which includes fuzzy logic (FL), neural network (NN), and evolutionary computation (EC), is an imperative branch of artificial intelligence (AI). As a core technology of AI, it plays a vital role in developing intelligent systems, such as games and game engines, neural-based systems including a variety of deep network models, evolutionary-based optimization methods, and advanced cognitive techniques. The 2021 IEEE CIS Summer School on CI for High-School Student Learning was held physically at the JanFuSun Resort Hotel, Taiwan, and virtually on Zoom, on August 10-12, 2021. The main contents of the Summer School were lectures focused on the basics of FL, NN, and EC and the workshop on AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things). Invited speakers gave nine courses covering topics like CI real-world applications, fundamentals of FL, and the introduction to NN and EC. The 2021 Summer School was supported by the 2021 IEEE CIS High School Outreach Subcommittee. We also invited students and teachers of high and elementary schools from Taiwan, Japan, and Indonesia. They attended the school and participated in AIoT workshop, gaining experience in applications of AIoT-FML learning tools. According to the short report and feedback from the involved students and teachers, we find out that most participants have quickly understood the principles of CI, FL, NN, and EC. In addition, one of the teachers sent the following remark to the organizers:\"This is a great event to introduce students to computational intelligence at a young age, stimulate them to be involved in rapidly evolving fields, and foster participation in future research adventures.\"",
