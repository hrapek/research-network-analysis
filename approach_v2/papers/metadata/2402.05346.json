    "abstract": "People aptly exhibit general intelligence behaviors in solving a variety of tasks with flexibility and ability to adapt to novel situations by reusing and applying high-level knowledge acquired over time. But artificial agents are more like specialists, lacking such generalist behaviors. Artificial agents will require understanding and exploiting critical structured knowledge representations. We present a metacognitive generalization framework, Knowledge-Interaction-eXecution (KIX), and argue that interactions with objects leveraging type space facilitate the learning of transferable interaction concepts and generalization. It is a natural way of integrating knowledge into reinforcement learning and is promising to act as an enabler for autonomous and generalist behaviors in artificial intelligence systems.",
