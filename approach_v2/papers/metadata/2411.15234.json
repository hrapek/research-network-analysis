    "abstract": "Biological intelligence is inherently adaptive -- animals continually adjust their actions based on environmental feedback. However, creating adaptive artificial intelligence (AI) remains a major challenge. The next frontier is to go beyond traditional AI to develop\"adaptive intelligence,\"defined here as harnessing insights from biological intelligence to build agents that can learn online, generalize, and rapidly adapt to changes in their environment. Recent advances in neuroscience offer inspiration through studies that increasingly focus on how animals naturally learn and adapt their world models. In this Perspective, I will review the behavioral and neural foundations of adaptive biological intelligence, the parallel progress in AI, and explore brain-inspired approaches for building more adaptive algorithms.",
