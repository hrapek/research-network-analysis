    "abstract": "In recent years, gas recognition technology has received considerable attention. Nevertheless, the gas recognition area has faced obstacles in implementing deep learning-based recognition solutions due to the absence of standardized protocols. To tackle this problem, we suggest a new GRU. Compared to other models, GRU obtains a higher identification accuracy.",
