    "abstract": "Nanorobots are a promising development in targeted drug delivery and the treatment of neurological disorders, with potential for crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These small devices leverage advancements in nanotechnology and bioengineering for precise navigation and targeted payload delivery, particularly for conditions like brain tumors, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has improved the navigation and effectiveness of nanorobots, allowing them to detect and interact with cancer cells through biomarker analysis. This study presents a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimizing nanorobot navigation in complex biological environments, focusing on cancer cell detection by analyzing the concentration gradients of surrounding biomarkers. We utilize a computer simulation model to explore the behavior of nanorobots in a three-dimensional space with cancer cells and biological barriers. The proposed method uses Q-learning to refine movement strategies based on real-time biomarker concentration data, enabling nanorobots to autonomously navigate to cancerous tissues for targeted drug delivery. This research lays the groundwork for future laboratory experiments and clinical applications, with implications for personalized medicine and less invasive cancer treatments. The integration of intelligent nanorobots could revolutionize therapeutic strategies, reducing side effects and enhancing treatment effectiveness for cancer patients. Further research will investigate the practical deployment of these technologies in medical settings, aiming to unlock the full potential of nanorobotics in healthcare.",
