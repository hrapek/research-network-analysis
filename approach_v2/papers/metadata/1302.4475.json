    "abstract": "The article looks at mass market artificial intelligence tools in the context of their ever-growing sophistication, availability and market penetration. The subject is especially relevant today for these exact reasons - if a few years ago AI was the subject of high tech research and science fiction novels, today, we increasingly rely on cloud robotics to cater to our daily needs - to trade stock, predict weather, manage diaries, find friends and buy presents online.",
