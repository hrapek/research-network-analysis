    "abstract": "This document focuses on the threats, especially near-term threats, that Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings to society. Most of the threats discussed here can result from any algorithmic process, not just AI; in addition, defining AI is notoriously difficult. For both reasons, it is important to think of\"A+AI\": Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence. In addition to the threats, this paper discusses countermeasures to them, and it includes a table showing which countermeasures are likely to mitigate which threats. Thoughtful governance could manage the risks without seriously impeding progress; in fact, chances are it would accelerate progress by reducing the social chaos that would otherwise be likely. The paper lists specific actions government should take as soon as possible, namely: * Require all social media platforms accessible in the U.S. to offer users verification that their accounts are owned by citizens, and to display every account's verification status * Establish regulations to require that all products created or significantly modified with A+AI be clearly labeled as such; to restrict use of generative AI to create likenesses of persons; and to require creators of generative AI software to disclose materials used to train their software and to compensate the creators of any copyrighted material used * Fund a crash project of research on mitigating the threats * Fund educational campaigns to raise awareness of the threats",
