    "abstract": "Artificial Expert Intelligence (AEI) seeks to transcend the limitations of both Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and narrow AI by integrating domain-specific expertise with critical, precise reasoning capabilities akin to those of top human experts. Existing AI systems often excel at predefined tasks but struggle with adaptability and precision in novel problem-solving. To overcome this, AEI introduces a framework for ``Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Reasoning\". This paradigm provides robust theoretical guarantees for reliably decomposing complex problems, with a practical mechanism for controlling reasoning precision. In reference to the division of human thought into System 1 for intuitive thinking and System 2 for reflective reasoning~\\citep{tversky1974judgment}, we refer to this new type of reasoning as System 3 for precise reasoning, inspired by the rigor of the scientific method. AEI thus establishes a foundation for error-bounded, inference-time learning.",
