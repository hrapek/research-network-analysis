    "abstract": "In the industrial e-commerce landscape, creative designs such as banners and posters are ubiquitous. Extracting structured semantic information from creative e-commerce design materials (manuscripts crafted by designers) to obtain design semantics represents a core challenge in the realm of intelligent design. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive automated framework for intelligently parsing creative materials. This framework comprises material recognition, preprocess, smartname, and label layers. The material recognition layer consolidates various detection and recognition interfaces, covering business aspects including detection of auxiliary areas within creative materials and layer-level detection, alongside label identification. Algorithmically, it encompasses a variety of coarse-to-fine methods such as Cascade RCNN, GFL, and other models. The preprocess layer involves filtering creative layers and grading creative materials. The smartname layer achieves intelligent naming for creative materials, while the label layer covers multi-level tagging for creative materials, enabling tagging at different hierarchical levels. Intelligent parsing constitutes a complete parsing framework that significantly aids downstream processes such as intelligent creation, creative optimization, and material library construction. Within the practical business applications at Suning, it markedly enhances the exposure, circulation, and click-through rates of creative materials, expediting the closed-loop production of creative materials and yielding substantial benefits.",
