    "abstract": "This introductory chapter provides an overview of the evolution and impact of Artificial Intelligence technologies in today society. Beginning with a historical context while exploring a few general definitions of AI, the author provides a timeline of the used technologies, highlighting its periods of stagnation, commonly referred to as AI winters, and the subsequent resurgence fueled by relentless enthusiasm and investment. The narrative then transitions to focus on the transformative effects of AI on society at large, with a particular emphasis on educational applications. Through examples, the paper shows how AI technologies have moved from theoretical constructs to practical tools that are reshaping pedagogical approaches and student engagement. The essay concludes by discussing the prospects of AI in education, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that considers both technological advancements and societal implications.",
