    "abstract": "The evolution of cybersecurity has spurred the emergence of autonomous threat hunting as a pivotal paradigm in the realm of AI-driven threat intelligence. This review navigates through the intricate landscape of autonomous threat hunting, exploring its significance and pivotal role in fortifying cyber defense mechanisms. Delving into the amalgamation of artificial intelligence (AI) and traditional threat intelligence methodologies, this paper delineates the necessity and evolution of autonomous approaches in combating contemporary cyber threats. Through a comprehensive exploration of foundational AI-driven threat intelligence, the review accentuates the transformative influence of AI and machine learning on conventional threat intelligence practices. It elucidates the conceptual framework underpinning autonomous threat hunting, spotlighting its components, and the seamless integration of AI algorithms within threat hunting processes.. Insightful discussions on challenges encompassing scalability, interpretability, and ethical considerations in AI-driven models enrich the discourse. Moreover, through illuminating case studies and evaluations, this paper showcases real-world implementations, underscoring success stories and lessons learned by organizations adopting AI-driven threat intelligence. In conclusion, this review consolidates key insights, emphasizing the substantial implications of autonomous threat hunting for the future of cybersecurity. It underscores the significance of continual research and collaborative efforts in harnessing the potential of AI-driven approaches to fortify cyber defenses against evolving threats.",
