    "abstract": "This paper introduces a comprehensive artificial intelligence operating system tailored for low-altitude aviation applications, integrating cutting-edge technologies for enhanced performance, safety, and efficiency. The system comprises six core components: OrinFlight OS, a high-performance operating system optimized for real-time task execution; UnitedVision, a versatile visual processing module supporting advanced image analysis; UnitedSense, a multi-sensor fusion module providing precise environmental modeling; UnitedNavigator, a dynamic path-planning and navigation system; UnitedMatrix, enabling multi-drone coordination and task execution; and UnitedInSight, a ground station for monitoring and management. Complemented by the UA DevKit low-code platform, the system facilitates user-friendly customization and application development. Leveraging NVIDIA Orin's computational power and advanced AI algorithms, this system addresses complex challenges in modern aviation, offering robust solutions for navigation, perception, and collaborative operations. This work highlights the system's architecture, features, and potential applications, demonstrating its ability to meet the demands of intelligent aviation environments.",
