    "abstract": "The article discusses development of autonomous artificial intelligence systems for corporate management. The function of a corporate director is still one of the few that are legislated for execution by a \u201cnatural\u201d rather than an \u201cartificial\u201d person. The main prerequisites for development of systems for full automation of management decisions made at the level of a board of directors are formed in the field of corporate law, machine learning, and compliance with the rules of non-discrimination, transparency, and accountability of decisions made and algorithms applied. The basic methodological approaches in terms of corporate law for the \u201cautonomous director\u201d have already been developed and do not get rejection among representatives of the legal sciences. However, there is an undeniable need for further extensive research in order to amend corporate law to effectively introduce \u201cautonomous directors\u201d. In practice, there are two main options of management decisions automation at the level of top management and a board of directors: digital command centers or automation of separate functions. Artificial intelligence systems will be subject to the same strict requirements for non-discrimination, transparency, and accountability as \u201cnatural\u201d directors. At a certain stage, autonomous systems can be an effective tool for countries, regions, and companies with a shortage of human capital, equalizing or providing additional chances for such countries and companies to compete on the global market.",
