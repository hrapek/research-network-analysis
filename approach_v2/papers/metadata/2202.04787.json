    "abstract": "The Robust Artificial Intelligence System Assurance (RAISA) workshop will focus on research, development and application of robust artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems. Rather than studying robustness with respect to particular ML algorithms, our approach will be to explore robustness assurance at the system architecture level, during both development and deployment, and within the human-machine teaming context. While the research community is converging on robust solutions for individual AI models in specific scenarios, the problem of evaluating and assuring the robustness of an AI system across its entire life cycle is much more complex. Moreover, the operational context in which AI systems are deployed necessitates consideration of robustness and its relation to principles of fairness, privacy, and explainability.",
