    "abstract": "Current imaging methods for diagnosing breast cancer (BC) are associated with limited sensitivity and specificity and modest positive predictive power. The recent progress in image analysis using artificial intelligence (AI) has created great promise to improve BC diagnosis and subtype differentiation. In this case, novel quantitative computational methods, such as radiomics, have been developed to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of early BC diagnosis and classification. The potential of radiomics in improving the diagnostic efficacy of imaging studies has been shown in several studies. In this review article, we discuss the radiomics workflow and current handcrafted radiomics methods in the diagnosis and classification of BC based on the most recent studies on different imaging modalities, e.g., MRI, mammography, contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM), ultrasound imaging, and digital breast tumosynthesis (DBT). We also discuss current challenges and potential strategies to improve the specificity and sensitivity of radiomics in breast cancer to help achieve a higher level of BC classification and diagnosis in the clinical setting. The growing field of AI incorporation with imaging information has opened a great opportunity to provide a higher level of care for BC patients.",
