    "abstract": "Datascouting is one of the most known data applications in professional sport, and specifically football. Its objective is to analyze huge database of players in order to detect high potentials that can be then individually considered by human scouts. In this paper, we propose a stacking-based deep learning model to detect high potential football players. Applied on open-source database, our model obtains significantly better results that classical statistical methods.",
