    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence is now recognized as a general-purpose technology with ample impact on human life. This work aims at understanding the evolution of AI and, in particular Machine learning, from the perspective of researchers' contributions to the field. In order to do so, we present several measures allowing the analyses of AI and machine learning researchers' impact, influence, and leadership over the last decades. This work also contributes, to a certain extent, to shed new light on the history and evolution of AI by exploring the dynamics involved in the field's evolution by looking at papers published at the flagship AI and machine learning conferences since the first International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) held in 1969. AI development and evolution have led to increasing research output, reflected in the number of articles published over the last sixty years. We construct comprehensive citation collaboration and paper-author datasets and compute corresponding centrality measures to carry out our analyses. These analyses allow a better understanding of how AI has reached its current state of affairs in research. Throughout the process, we correlate these datasets with the work of the ACM Turing Award winners and the so-called two AI winters the field has gone through. We also look at self-citation trends and new authors' behaviors. Finally, we present a novel way to infer the country of affiliation of a paper from its organization. Therefore, this work provides a deep analysis of Artificial Intelligence history from information gathered and analysed from large technical venues datasets and suggests novel insights that can contribute to understanding and measuring AI's evolution.",
