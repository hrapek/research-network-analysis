    "abstract": "In the vast domain of cybersecurity, the transition from reactive defense to offensive has become critical in protecting digital infrastructures. This paper explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into offensive cybersecurity, particularly through the development of an autonomous AI agent, ReaperAI, designed to simulate and execute cyberattacks. Leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, ReaperAI demonstrates the potential to identify, exploit, and analyze security vulnerabilities autonomously. This research outlines the core methodologies that can be utilized to increase consistency and performance, including task-driven penetration testing frameworks, AI-driven command generation, and advanced prompting techniques. The AI agent operates within a structured environment using Python, enhanced by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for contextual understanding and memory retention. ReaperAI was tested on platforms including, Hack The Box, where it successfully exploited known vulnerabilities, demonstrating its potential power. However, the deployment of AI in offensive security presents significant ethical and operational challenges. The agent's development process revealed complexities in command execution, error handling, and maintaining ethical constraints, highlighting areas for future enhancement. This study contributes to the discussion on AI's role in cybersecurity by showcasing how AI can augment offensive security strategies. It also proposes future research directions, including the refinement of AI interactions with cybersecurity tools, enhancement of learning mechanisms, and the discussion of ethical guidelines for AI in offensive roles. The findings advocate for a unique approach to AI implementation in cybersecurity, emphasizing innovation.",
