    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence systems become integral across domains, the demand for explainability grows, the called eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Existing efforts primarily focus on generating and evaluating explanations for black-box models while a critical gap in directly enhancing models remains through these evaluations. It is important to consider the potential of this explanation process to improve model quality with a feedback on training as well. XAI may be used to improve model performance while boosting its explainability. Under this view, this paper introduces Transformation - Selective Hidden Input Evaluation for Learning Dynamics (T-SHIELD), a regularization family designed to improve model quality by hiding features of input, forcing the model to generalize without those features. Within this family, we propose the XAI - SHIELD(X-SHIELD), a regularization for explainable artificial intelligence, which uses explanations to select specific features to hide. In contrast to conventional approaches, X-SHIELD regularization seamlessly integrates into the objective function enhancing model explainability while also improving performance. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets underscores X-SHIELD's effectiveness in improving performance and overall explainability. The improvement is validated through experiments comparing models with and without the X-SHIELD regularization, with further analysis exploring the rationale behind its design choices. This establishes X-SHIELD regularization as a promising pathway for developing reliable artificial intelligence regularization.",
